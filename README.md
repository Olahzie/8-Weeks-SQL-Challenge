### Business problem summary
Danny wants to expand his new Pizza Empire ,so he decided to Uberize it which led to the launching of Pizza Runner. Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers. Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth. He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

### Business problem summary

Danny created Foodie-Fi; a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows, with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.
